# Module 01 - Inception üöÄ

Welcome to the "Inception" module of the "Namaste React" course! In this module, we'll embark on our React journey from scratch. Let's dive into the details and see what we'll learn.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

Setting up your development environment is the first step. We want to make sure you're ready to code with React. Here's what we cover:

-   ‚úÖ Editor: VS Code
-   ‚úÖ Browser: Google Chrome
-   ‚úÖ Must-Have VS Code Extensions:

    -   [bracket pair colorization toggler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
    -   [es7+ react/redux](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)
    -   [gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
    -   [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    -   [prettifyjson](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohsen1.prettify-json)

## üìú Theory

Understanding the fundamentals is crucial. Here's what we'll explore:

-   ‚ùì **Emmet**: A text editor add-on for faster coding, expanding shortcuts into full code.

-   ‚ùì **Module vs. Package**: Modules are single JavaScript files, while packages are directories with modules and a `package.json` file.

-   ‚ùì **Library vs. Framework**: Libraries are collections of code for developers to call, frameworks dictate application flow and structure.

-   ‚ùì **CDN**: Content Delivery Network - speeds up content delivery by distributing resources geographically.

-   ‚ùì **React's Name**: React is named for its ability to react to data changes, automatically updating the UI.

-   ‚ùì **Crossorigin**: Attribute in script tags used for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) control.

-   ‚ùì **React vs. ReactDOM**: React is for UI building, ReactDOM interacts with the DOM to render React components.

-   ‚ùì **react.development.js vs. react.production.js**: Development version is readable for debugging, production version is optimized.

-   ‚ùì **Async vs. Defer**: Attributes in script tags for loading scripts asynchronously, with defer ensuring order.

## üíª Coding

Time to get hands-on! Here's what we'll code:

1. **HTML Boilerplate**: Set up your development environment with a basic HTML boilerplate using Emmet.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>Namaste React</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="root"></div>
		<script src="app.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

üöÄ Module Summary
We started our React journey by setting up the development environment.
Key extensions for VS Code were installed for a smoother coding experience.
We created an HTML boilerplate template and learned about Emmet.
A simple JavaScript program displayed "Namaste Everyone" in an h1 tag.
React made its debut with the same program implemented using CDN links.
We explored the concepts of React elements, createRoot(), and render().
Styling was introduced with the addition of a style.css file.
